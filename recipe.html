  <h1>Recipes - World's Best Scrambled Eggs</h1>
<p>I adapted this recipe from a book called Sydney Food by Bill Grainger.
  Ever since tasting these eggs on my 1st visit to Bill's restaurant in Kings Cross, Sydney,
  I have been after the recipe. I have since transformed it into what I really believe are the
  best scrambled eggs I have ever tasted.</p>

<p>This recipe is what I call a very special breakfast; just look at the ingredients
  to see why. It has to be tasted to be believed.</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
The following ingredients make one serving:
<ul>
<li>2 eggs</li>
<li>1 tablespoon of butter <i>(10g)</i></li>
<li>1/3 cup of cream <i>(2 3/4 fl ounces)</i></li>
<li>A pinch of salt</li>
<li>Freshly milled black pepper</li>
<li>3 fresh chives <i>(chopped)</i></li>
</ul>
<h2>Instructions</h2>
<ol>
<li>Whisk eggs, cream, and salt in a bowl.</li>
<li>Melt the butter in a non-stick pan over a high heat <i>(taking care not to burn the butter)</i>.</li>
<li>Pour egg mixture into pan and wait until it starts setting around the edge of the pan <i>(around 20 seconds)</i>.</li>
<li>Using a wooden spatula, bring the mixture into the center as if it were an omelet, and let it cook for another 20 seconds.</li>
<li>Fold contents in again, leave for 20 seconds, and repeat until the eggs are only just done.</li>
<li>Grind a light sprinkling of freshly milled pepper over the eggs and blend in some chopped fresh chives.</li>
</ol>
You should only make a <b>maximum</b> of two servings per frying pan.
